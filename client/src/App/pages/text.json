    "about": [
        "Hi! I'm Edmond. I'm currently pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, studying at home in San Diego. I plan to graduate in May 2022.",
        "My main passion is in creating useful, low-cost solutions to problems, which often combines both software and hardware. While I like to use hardware, I love to create software. I primarily use Python, although I've also had experience in Java, JavaScript, C, and C++. In web development, I've used tools such as React, Node.js, Bootstrap, Express, MongoDB, and REST APIs to make things work.",
        "This semester, I'm helping to conduct research at UC Berkeley's RISE Lab. There, I explore the possibilities of end-to-end machine learning models on self-driving cars. I collect training data using a simulator as well as train models using PyTorch.",
        "In my spare time, I like to tinker with and explore new technologies. In the past, I've built quadcopters from scratch and used open-source firmware. These days, I enjoy working with IoT and am always considering what I can do next.",
        "In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing tennis, and trying new foods. Occasionally, I might learn a new song on the piano, fold some intricate origami, or just draw and color something completely random."
